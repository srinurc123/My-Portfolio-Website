Personal Portfolio ::
Project Overview:
The Personal Portfolio project is a web-based application developed to showcase my professional profile, skills, education, projects, and contact details in a structured and interactive manner. The portfolio acts as a digital resume, providing an online presence that allows recruiters, peers, and collaborators to explore my background and work in detail.
This project highlights not only my technical skills but also my ability to design and build a complete web application. It demonstrates a blend of frontend design and backend integration, making it a full-stack project. The main purpose of creating the portfolio was to present myself in a professional way and provide an easy channel for communication and networking.

Objective :
The primary objective of this portfolio was to have a single platform where all my professional details could be displayed and accessed anytime. Instead of sharing static resumes, this dynamic portfolio offers an interactive way for others to understand my skills, explore my projects, and connect with me.

Tech Stack Used : 
HTML was used for creating the structure and layout of the web pages.
CSS was implemented to design and style the user interface, ensuring a clean and responsive look.
JavaScript was included to add interactivity and handle basic dynamic operations on the frontend.
React was used as the main frontend library to build reusable components and maintain a smooth single-page application experience.
GitHub was used to host and manage the code with version control, while GitHub Pages or another deployment service was used to make the portfolio live and accessible.

Features Implemented : 
Homepage containing a professional introduction and navigation to different sections.
About section summarizing education, skills, and career objectives.
Projects section listing my major academic and personal projects with descriptions and links to GitHub repositories.
Skills section providing a categorized list of technical skills with focus areas in Java, backend, and web development.
Contact section containing a form to allow recruiters or collaborators to get in touch directly.
Responsive design ensuring accessibility and usability on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
Clean UI and smooth navigation achieved using React components and routing.

Why These Technologies Were Used :
React was selected because it allows building modular, reusable UI components and provides better performance for single-page applications.
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used as they form the foundation of frontend development.
GitHub Pages was chosen for deployment as it provides a free and reliable hosting solution for web projects.

My Role in the Project :
I designed and developed the entire portfolio application. I worked on creating the frontend structure using javascript, styled the pages for a professional look, and ensured responsive design. integrated it into the frontend. All source code was version controlled using GitHub and finally deployed online for easy access.

Learning Outcomes :
Through this project, I gained practical knowledge of frontend design principles,  I also practiced backend integration using frontend technologies. Additionally, I learned how to deploy projects on GitHub Pages and improve my Git workflow for real-world projects.
